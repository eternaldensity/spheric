# Altered Items Reference

Complete reference for all Altered Items, including base and enhanced values.

See [[Altered Items]] for the gameplay guide.

## Base Effects

~0.1% of tiles contain an Altered Item. Building on the tile grants the effect permanently.

| Altered Item | Effect | Mechanical Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Resonance Accelerator | 2x production speed | Building tick rate halved |
| Probability Fracture | Output duplication | 5% chance per output to produce 2 items |
| Thermal Anomaly | 2x processing yield | [[Extraction & Processing|Processors]] and [[The Distiller|Distillers]] output 2 per 1 input |
| Spatial Distortion | Triple capture radius | [[Creatures & Containment|Trap]] radius: 3 → 9 tiles |
| Shifting Anchor | Skip downstream | Output items bypass the next [[The Conduit Network|building in the chain]] |

## Enhanced Effects (with Altered Resonance)

After obtaining the **[[Objects of Power|Altered Resonance]]** Object of Power at Clearance 6, all effects are **doubled**:

| Altered Item | Base Effect | Enhanced Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Resonance Accelerator | 2x speed | **4x speed** |
| Probability Fracture | 5% duplication | **10% duplication** |
| Thermal Anomaly | 2x yield | **4x yield** |
| Spatial Distortion | 3x radius (3 → 9) | **6x radius (3 → 18)** |
| Shifting Anchor | Skip 1 building | **Skip 2 buildings** |

## Best Uses

| Altered Item | Ideal Building Placement |
|---|---|
| Resonance Accelerator | Your slowest bottleneck (Particle Collider, Paranatural Synthesizer) |
| Probability Fracture | High-value output (late-game crafters where doubling output matters most) |
| Thermal Anomaly | High-demand Processor or Distiller line |
| Spatial Distortion | Trap (massive capture area) |
| Shifting Anchor | Niche routing optimizations |
