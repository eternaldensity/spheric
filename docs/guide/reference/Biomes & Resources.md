# Biomes & Resources

## Biomes

The sphere's surface is divided into five biome types based on latitude.

| Biome | Bureau Designation | Latitude | Creatures Found |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grassland | Threshold Plain | Mid-latitudes | Copper Beetle, Spore Cloud, Resonance Moth, Ferric Sentinel |
| Desert | Arid Expanse | Low-latitudes | Ember Wisp, Static Mote, Flux Serpent, Phase Wisp |
| Tundra | Permafrost Zone | High-latitudes | Frost Shard, Quartz Drone, Resonance Moth, Phase Wisp |
| Forest | Overgrowth Sector | Mid-latitudes | Shadow Tendril, Quartz Drone, Spore Cloud, Resonance Moth |
| Volcanic | Astral Rift | Extreme zones | Ember Wisp, Void Fragment, Flux Serpent, Ferric Sentinel |

See [[Creature Reference]] for full creature details.

## The Shift Cycle

Each biome may have production modifiers during different shift phases:

| Phase | Duration |
|---|---|
| Dawn Shift | 600 ticks (~2 min) |
| Zenith Shift | 600 ticks |
| Dusk Shift | 600 ticks |
| Nadir Shift | 600 ticks |

Full cycle: **2400 ticks** (~8 minutes).

## Resources

Roughly **8% of tiles** contain resource deposits. Each deposit holds **100–500 units**.
