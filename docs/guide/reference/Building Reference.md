# Building Reference

Complete building list with Bureau names, clearance tiers, and construction costs.

Construction costs are the resources you must deliver to a building's construction site before it becomes operational. [[Your Starter Kit|Starter Kit]] buildings skip construction entirely. See [[Placing Your First Buildings#Step 6 Construction|Construction]] for details.

> [!warning] Contains all buildings including late-game spoilers.
