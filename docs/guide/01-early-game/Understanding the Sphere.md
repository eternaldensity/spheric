# Understanding the Sphere

The sphere is divided into **30 faces**, each containing a **64x64 grid of tiles**. That's over 122,000 tiles in total.

## Biomes

Each region belongs to one of five biomes, determined by latitude:

| Bureau Designation | Common Name | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Threshold Plain | Grassland | Neutral, temperate terrain |
| Arid Expanse | Desert | Hot, sandy zones |
| Permafrost Zone | Tundra | Cold, icy regions |
| Overgrowth Sector | Forest | Dense, vegetated areas |
| Astral Rift | Volcanic | Extreme, otherworldly terrain |

Biomes affect which [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] spawn nearby and can influence production during different shift phases. See [[Biomes & Resources]] for full details.

## Resources

Resources appear in **ore veins** — clusters of the same type that form natural deposits. When you select a tile, the info panel shows what's there.

At Clearance 0, you only need to worry about two:

| Bureau Name | Common Name | What It Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| Ferric Compound | Iron | Ferric Standard (ingot) |
| Paraelectric Ore | Copper | Paraelectric Bar (ingot) |

Resources are **finite**. Each deposit contains **100–500 units**. When a deposit is exhausted, the [[Extraction & Processing|Extractor]] stops producing.

More resources (Resonance Crystal, Astral Ore, Black Rock Ichor, Threshold Dust, Threshold Radiant) become relevant as you advance. See [[Production Chains]] and [[Biomes & Resources]].

## The Shift Cycle

The sphere has a day/night cycle called the **Shift Cycle**, with four phases:

| Phase | Character |
|---|---|
| **Dawn Shift** | Morning light |
| **Zenith Shift** | Full daylight |
| **Dusk Shift** | Evening |
| **Nadir Shift** | Darkness |

Each phase lasts **1200 ticks** (~4 minutes), making a full day **4800 ticks** (~16 minutes). The cycle affects biome production modifiers and determines which areas are lit or in shadow.

## Seasons

The sphere has a **seasonal cycle** driven by axial tilt, just like a real planet. The sun's path shifts north and south over the course of a **30-day year** (~8 hours real-time):

- At the **equinoxes**, the sun tracks along the equator — all latitudes get roughly equal day/night
- At the **solstices**, the sun tilts toward one pole — polar regions experience extended daylight or darkness

This means **latitude matters for lighting**. Shadow Panels near the poles may produce power for longer stretches during their hemisphere's winter, while equatorial regions stay more consistent year-round. See [[Power & Energy#Shadow Panel]] and [[Biomes & Resources#The Shift Cycle]] for details.
