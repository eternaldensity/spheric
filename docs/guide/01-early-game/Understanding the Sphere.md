# Understanding the Sphere

The sphere is divided into **30 faces**, each containing a **64x64 grid of tiles**. That's over 122,000 tiles in total.

## Biomes

Each region belongs to one of five biomes, determined by latitude:

| Biome | Bureau Designation | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Grassland | Threshold Plain | Neutral, temperate terrain |
| Desert | Arid Expanse | Hot, sandy zones |
| Tundra | Permafrost Zone | Cold, icy regions |
| Forest | Overgrowth Sector | Dense, vegetated areas |
| Volcanic | Astral Rift | Extreme, otherworldly terrain |

Biomes affect which [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] spawn nearby and can influence production during different shift phases. See [[Biomes & Resources]] for full details.

## Resources

Roughly **8% of tiles** contain natural resource deposits. When you select a tile, the info panel shows what's there.

At Clearance 0, you only need to worry about two:

| Resource | Bureau Name | What It Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| Iron | Ferric Compound | Ferric Standard (ingot) |
| Copper | Paraelectric Ore | Paraelectric Bar (ingot) |

Resources are **finite**. Each deposit contains **100–500 units**. When a deposit is exhausted, the [[Mining & Smelting|Extractor]] stops producing.

More resources (Quartz, Titanium, Oil, Sulfur, Uranium) become relevant as you advance. See [[Production Chains]] and [[Biomes & Resources]].

## The Shift Cycle

The sphere has a day/night cycle called the **Shift Cycle**, with four phases:

| Phase | Character |
|---|---|
| **Dawn Shift** | Morning light |
| **Zenith Shift** | Full daylight |
| **Dusk Shift** | Evening |
| **Nadir Shift** | Darkness |

Each phase lasts **600 ticks** (~2 minutes). The cycle is primarily visual but can affect biome production modifiers.
