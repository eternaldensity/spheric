# Early Game Tips

> [!tip] Getting Started Efficiently
> These tips will save you time and resources in your first session.

## Location

- **Find a cluster of Ferric Compound and Paraelectric Ore deposits** near each other before building. This minimizes [[The Conveyor Network|Conduit]] length.
- Click tiles to scout before committing to a layout.

## Building

- **Orientation is everything.** Before placing, press **R** to check the facing direction. A misaligned building wastes resources.
- **Use Line Mode (L)** for long Conduit runs. It's much faster than placing one at a time.

## Production

- **Don't spread too thin.** Focus on one Ferric Compound line and one Paraelectric Ore line first.
- Your immediate goal is **50 Ferric Standards** and **30 Paraelectric Bars** for [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]].

## Preparation

- **Place your [[Your Starter Kit#Gathering Post|Gathering Post]]** near where you're building — it attracts [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] that will be useful later.
- **[[Claiming Territory|Claim your territory]] early** once you unlock the Jurisdiction Beacon. Other Operators share the sphere.

## Inspection

- **Check tile info** by clicking any tile — it shows resources, [[Biomes & Resources|biome]], buildings, and corruption status.
- Tiles with an **[[Altered Items|Altered Item]]** indicator are valuable — remember their locations for later.
