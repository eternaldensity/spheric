# Controls & Camera

You view the sphere through a **camera drone** that flies above the surface.

## Camera Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **Left Click** (on sphere) | Fly the drone to that point |
| **Scroll Wheel** | Raise / lower drone altitude |
| **Right-Click + Drag** | Orbit the view around the current hover point |

Click anywhere on the sphere and the drone will smoothly glide along the surface to hover above that spot. Scroll up to gain altitude for a wider view, or scroll down to get closer to the surface for precise building work.

> [!tip] Orbit
> Right-click and drag to tilt and rotate the camera around where you're hovering. This lets you look at buildings from different angles without moving the drone.

> [!note] Camera Persistence
> Your camera position and altitude are saved in your browser. When you return, the drone will be right where you left it.

## Waypoints

Press **W** to open the **Waypoints** panel. Waypoints let you bookmark locations on the sphere so you can quickly return to them later — your base, a resource deposit, or anything worth revisiting.

1. **Click a tile** on the sphere to select it.
2. Open the Waypoints panel (**W**).
3. Type a name and click **Save**.
4. Click **Fly** on any saved waypoint to send your drone there instantly.

Waypoints are saved in your browser and persist across sessions. You can delete a waypoint with the **X** button next to it.

> [!tip] Navigating a Sphere
> On a sphere, it's easy to lose track of where you've been. Save a waypoint at your main base early — you'll thank yourself later.
