# Controls & Camera

You view the sphere through a **camera drone** that flies above the surface.

## Camera Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **Left Click** (on sphere) | Fly the drone to that point |
| **Scroll Wheel** | Raise / lower drone altitude |
| **Right-Click + Drag** | Orbit the view around the current hover point |

Click anywhere on the sphere and the drone will smoothly glide along the surface to hover above that spot. Scroll up to gain altitude for a wider view, or scroll down to get closer to the surface for precise building work.

> [!tip] Orbit
> Right-click and drag to tilt and rotate the camera around where you're hovering. This lets you look at buildings from different angles without moving the drone.

> [!note] Camera Persistence
> Your camera position and altitude are saved in your browser. When you return, the drone will be right where you left it.
