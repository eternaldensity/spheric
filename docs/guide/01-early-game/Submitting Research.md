# Submitting Research

The **Submission Terminal** is how you advance through the Bureau's clearance levels.

## How It Works

1. Place a Terminal at the end of a [[The Conveyor Network|conveyor]] chain
2. Items delivered via conveyors are automatically accepted
3. Open the **Case Files** panel (**F** key) to see current requirements
4. Submitted items count toward completing case files
5. When all case files for a tier are done, you gain the next **Clearance Level**

## Case Files

Each clearance level has one or more **case files** — research objectives that require specific items in specific quantities.

> [!tip] First Goal
> Your first two case files require:
> - **50 Ferric Standards** (iron ingots)
> - **30 Paraelectric Bars** (copper ingots)
>
> Set up one iron chain and one copper chain feeding into your Terminal.

## What Clearance Gets You

Each new clearance level unlocks additional buildings, expanding what you can build. See [[Research Case Files]] for the complete list of requirements and unlocks per tier.

## Objects of Power

Completing **all** case files in a clearance tier also awards an **[[Objects of Power|Object of Power]]** — a permanent global bonus. Your first one (+10% production speed) comes at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]].
