# Your First Session

When you first connect, the Bureau assigns you:

- A **random name** and **color** (persisted in your browser)
- A **[[Your Starter Kit|Starter Kit]]** of free buildings
- **Clearance Level 0** — the lowest access tier

## Your Goal

Bootstrap a basic extraction-and-processing chain, submit materials to the Bureau for research, and climb the clearance ladder to unlock increasingly powerful buildings.

## The First 5 Minutes

1. **Get oriented.** Click and drag to rotate the sphere. Scroll to zoom. See [[Controls & Camera]] for full controls.
2. **Find resources.** Look for glowing tiles — these are resource deposits. Click a tile to inspect it.
3. **Place your Extractors.** Use your [[Your Starter Kit|Starter Kit]] buildings to set up a Ferric Compound extraction line.
4. **Connect with Conduits.** Chain buildings together so items flow from Extractor to Processor to Terminal.
5. **Start researching.** Once ingots reach your [[Submitting Research|Terminal]], you're on your way.

For a detailed walkthrough, continue to [[Placing Your First Buildings]].
