# What Is Spheric?

Spheric is a multiplayer factory-building game set on the surface of a sphere. You play as an **Operator** working for the **Federal Bureau of Control**, tasked with extracting resources, manufacturing components, researching anomalous technology, and eventually making contact with a mysterious entity known as **The Board**.

## The World

The world is a **rhombic triacontahedron** — a 30-faced polyhedron that approximates a sphere. Each face is a grid of tiles where you place buildings, extract resources, and build production chains. Think of it like Factorio, but wrapped around a ball.

## Multiplayer

The game is **multiplayer**: other Operators share the same sphere, each claiming territory and building their own industrial networks. You can trade with them, and some objectives require cooperation.

## Core Loop

1. **Extract** raw resources from the sphere's surface
2. **Process** them through smelters, refineries, and assemblers
3. **Submit** materials to the Bureau to unlock new technology
4. **Expand** your factory with increasingly complex production chains
5. **Defend** against a parasitic corruption called [[The Hiss & Corruption|The Hiss]]
6. **Capture** and evolve wild [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] that boost your buildings
7. **Cooperate** with other Operators toward the ultimate goal
