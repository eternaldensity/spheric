# Claiming Territory

Once you unlock the **Jurisdiction Beacon** (Claim Beacon) at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]], you can claim territory on the sphere.

## How It Works

- Place a Jurisdiction Beacon to claim a circular area of **radius 8 tiles**
- **Only you** can build within your claimed territory
- Other Operators cannot place overlapping claims
- Territory is shown visually with your Operator color

## Why Claim Early

The sphere is shared with all other Operators. Without a claim, anyone could build on "your" tiles. Claim your main production area as soon as possible to protect your infrastructure.

## Strategy

- Place your beacon **centrally** within your factory area to maximize coverage
- Radius 8 covers a good-sized production zone
- You can place **multiple beacons** to expand your territory as your factory grows
- Beacons themselves require: 5 Ferric Standard, 3 Paraelectric Bar

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Ferric Standard | 5 |
| Paraelectric Bar | 3 |

See [[Building Reference]] for all building costs.
