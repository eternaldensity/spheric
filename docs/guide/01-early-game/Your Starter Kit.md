# Your Starter Kit

Every new Operator receives these buildings for free:

| Bureau Name | Common Name | Qty | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conduit | Conveyor | 8 | Moves items between buildings |
| Extractor | Miner | 2 | Extracts raw ore from resource tiles |
| Processor | Smelter | 2 | Converts raw ore into ingots |
| Terminal | Submission Terminal | 1 | Submit items for Bureau [[Submitting Research|research]] |
| Gathering Post | Gathering Post | 1 | Attracts nearby [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] |

Starter Kit buildings are placed **instantly** — no construction required. Once your kit is used up, every new building must be constructed with resources (see [[Placing Your First Buildings#Step 6 Construction|Construction]]).

This is enough to set up your very first production line: two extraction chains (one Ferric Compound, one Paraelectric Ore) feeding into a Terminal.

## What Each Building Does

### Conduit (Conveyor)
The backbone of your factory. Pushes items one tile in its facing direction every tick. See [[The Conveyor Network]] for details.

### Extractor (Miner)
Place on a resource tile to begin extracting raw ore. Can only be placed on tiles with deposits. See [[Extraction & Processing]].

### Processor (Smelter)
Converts raw ore into usable ingots. Feed it ore via Conduits, and it outputs ingots. See [[Extraction & Processing]].

### Terminal
The gateway to progression. Items delivered here count toward [[Research Case Files|Case File]] completion. See [[Submitting Research]].

### Gathering Post
Place near your base. Attracts wild creatures within **radius 7**, making them easier to [[Creatures & Containment|capture]] later. Also produces **Entity Biofuel** as a byproduct — your primary source of [[Drone Fuel & the Drone Bay|drone fuel]] in the early game.
