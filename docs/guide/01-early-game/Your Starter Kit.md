# Your Starter Kit

Every new Operator receives these buildings for free:

| Building | Bureau Name | Qty | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conveyor | Conduit | 8 | Moves items between buildings |
| Miner | Extractor | 2 | Extracts raw ore from resource tiles |
| Smelter | Processor | 2 | Converts raw ore into ingots |
| Submission Terminal | Terminal | 1 | Submit items for Bureau [[Submitting Research|research]] |
| Gathering Post | Gathering Post | 1 | Attracts nearby [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] |

This is enough to set up your very first production line: two mining chains (one iron, one copper) feeding into a Submission Terminal.

## What Each Building Does

### Conveyor (Conduit)
The backbone of your factory. Pushes items one tile in its facing direction every tick. See [[The Conveyor Network]] for details.

### Miner (Extractor)
Place on a resource tile to begin extracting raw ore. Can only be placed on tiles with deposits. See [[Mining & Smelting]].

### Smelter (Processor)
Converts raw ore into usable ingots. Feed it ore via conveyors, and it outputs ingots. See [[Mining & Smelting]].

### Submission Terminal
The gateway to progression. Items delivered here count toward [[Research Case Files|Case File]] completion. See [[Submitting Research]].

### Gathering Post
Place near your base. Attracts wild creatures within **radius 7**, making them easier to [[Creatures & Containment|capture]] later.
