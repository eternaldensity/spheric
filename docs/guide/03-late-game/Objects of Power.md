# Objects of Power

Each clearance tier, when **fully completed** (all case files submitted), grants a permanent **Object of Power** — a global bonus that applies to your entire operation.

## All Objects of Power

| Clearance | Object of Power | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bureau Directive Alpha | +10% production speed for all structures |
| 2 | Pneumatic Transit Network | Teleport between owned [[Submitting Research\|Terminals]] |
| 3 | Astral Projection | See all [[Creatures & Containment\|creature]] locations on the sphere |
| 4 | Power Surge | +25% [[Power & Energy\|generator]] fuel duration |
| 5 | Logistics Mastery | All [[The Conveyor Network\|Conduits]] operate 20% faster |
| 6 | Altered Resonance | All [[Altered Items]] effects are doubled |
| 7 | Entity Communion | +50% [[Creatures & Containment\|creature]] boost stacking |
| 8 | Board's Favor | [[The Hiss & Corruption\|Corruption]] cannot seed within 10 tiles of your buildings |

## Stacking

> [!info] Cumulative Bonuses
> Objects of Power are **cumulative**. By Clearance 8, you have all eight bonuses active simultaneously. The combined effect dramatically increases your production efficiency and defensive capability.

## Highlights

### Altered Resonance (Clearance 6)
Doubles all [[Altered Items|Altered Item]] effects:
- Resonance Accelerator → **4x** speed
- Probability Fracture → **10%** duplication
- Thermal Anomaly → **4x** yield
- Spatial Distortion → **6x** capture radius
- Shifting Anchor → skip **2** downstream buildings

See [[Altered Items Reference]] for the full doubled-values table.

### Board's Favor (Clearance 8)
Corruption can't seed within 10 tiles of your buildings. Combined with [[Endgame Buildings|Dimensional Stabilizers]] and Purification Beacons, this makes your late-game base nearly immune to the Hiss.
