# Late Game Tips

> [!tip] Endgame Strategy
> The late game demands multi-tier production chains, careful resource management, and cooperation with other Operators.

## Resource Priorities

- **Secure uranium early.** Enriched Radiant is in nearly every endgame recipe. Start scouting and mining uranium deposits at Clearance 5–6.
- **Anomalous Essence is a consumable.** The [[Paranatural Synthesis|Paranatural Synthesizer]] eats it constantly. Build a reliable creature pipeline: Gathering Post → Trap → Essence Extractor.

## Creature Management

- **Evolve rare creatures for Synthesizers.** An evolved Void Fragment assigned to a Paranatural Synthesizer is the most efficient setup possible.
- **Use the [[Endgame Buildings|Astral Projection Chamber]]** to find rare creatures instead of manually scouting.

## Defense

- **Defend aggressively.** At high clearance, [[World Events|Hiss Surges]] become more dangerous. Layer Purification Beacons and Defense Arrays around your key infrastructure.
- **Build [[Endgame Buildings|Dimensional Stabilizers]]** for wide-area protection at Clearance 7.

## Altered Items

- **Leverage [[Objects of Power|Altered Resonance]].** At Clearance 6, the Object of Power doubles all [[Altered Items|Altered Item]] effects. A Resonance Accelerator tile gives **4x production speed**.
- Prioritize building your Particle Colliders and Synthesizers on Altered Item tiles.

## Board Contact Quest

- **Coordinate with other Operators.** [[Board Contact Quest|The quest]] needs 560 items — assign roles so each Operator focuses on 2–3 item types.
- **Don't forget Hiss Residue.** The quest needs 100 — you must actively fight the Hiss with Defense Arrays in corrupted zones.
- **[[Trading with Other Operators|Trade]]** to fill gaps in your production.

## Production Optimization

- Assign **Speed** [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] to bottleneck buildings (Particle Colliders, Synthesizers)
- Place key buildings on [[Altered Items|Altered Item]] tiles
- Ensure all production buildings are [[Power & Energy|powered]]
- Use [[Advanced Logistics#Containment Vault (Storage Container)|Containment Vaults]] to buffer intermediate products
