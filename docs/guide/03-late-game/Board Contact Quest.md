# Board Contact Quest

> [!danger] Final Endgame Spoiler
> This is the game's ultimate objective.

## Activation

The Board Contact quest activates when **any Operator on the server** reaches **Clearance 8**. Once activated, it appears in the **Board Contact** panel (**G** key) for all players.

## Cooperative Objective

This is a **server-wide cooperative quest**. All Operators contribute toward the same goal — no single player is expected to complete it alone.

## Requirements

All players collectively must submit:

| Item | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Board Resonator | 10 |
| Hypercomputation Core | 50 |
| Dimensional Core | 20 |
| Paranatural Composite | 100 |
| Radiant Cell | 50 |
| Anomaly Containment Module | 30 |
| Anomalous Essence | 200 |
| Hiss Residue | 100 |

**Total: 560 items** across 8 categories.

## How to Contribute

- Any Operator can submit items toward any category
- Progress is tracked server-wide in the Board Contact panel
- The panel shows contributor count and items submitted vs. required per category

## Sourcing the Items

| Item | Source |
|---|---|
| Board Resonator | [[Paranatural Synthesis\|Paranatural Synthesizer]] |
| Hypercomputation Core | [[High-Tech Manufacturing\|Particle Collider]] |
| Dimensional Core | Paranatural Synthesizer |
| Paranatural Composite | Particle Collider |
| Radiant Cell | [[Nuclear Processing\|Particle Collider (nuclear chain)]] |
| Anomaly Containment Module | Paranatural Synthesizer |
| Anomalous Essence | [[Creatures & Containment\|Creature capture]] → Essence Extractor |
| Hiss Residue | [[The Hiss & Corruption\|Defense Arrays]] killing Hiss entities |

> [!important] Hiss Residue
> This is the one requirement that can't come from your factory — you must actively fight [[The Hiss & Corruption|The Hiss]]. Build Defense Arrays in corrupted zones and let them farm Hiss Residue.

## Strategy

> [!tip] Coordination is Key
> - **Specialize:** Each Operator focuses on 2–3 item types
> - **[[Trading with Other Operators|Trade]]:** Exchange surplus items to fill gaps
> - **Communicate:** Use the player list to coordinate who's producing what
> - **Hiss duty:** Someone needs to handle the Hiss Residue requirement — volunteer or take turns

## Completion

When all requirements are met, the quest completes and **Contact is Established**. The Board acknowledges the collective achievement of all Operators on the sphere.
