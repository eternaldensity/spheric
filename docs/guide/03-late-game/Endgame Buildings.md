- Protects your late-game infrastructure

## Astral Projection Chamber

Reveals **all [[Creatures & Containment|creature]] locations** across the entire sphere when activated.

- Lets you find rare creatures without manually scouting
- Particularly useful for locating **Void Fragments** (only spawn in [[Biomes & Resources|Astral Rift]] biomes)
- Essential for maintaining your creature pipeline in the late game
