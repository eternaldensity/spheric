# Paranatural Synthesis

At **Clearance 7**, you unlock the **Paranatural Synthesizer** — the most complex production building in the game.

**Processing time:** 30 ticks

## Special Requirement

> [!important] Creature Required
> The Paranatural Synthesizer **will not operate** without an assigned [[Creatures & Containment|creature]]. Every recipe also consumes **Anomalous Essence** (creature essence), so you need a steady supply of captured creatures feeding an Essence Extractor.

## Recipes

| Input A | Input B | Input C | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypercomputation Core | Paranatural Composite | Anomalous Essence | Anomaly Containment Module |
| Radiant Cell | Anomaly Containment Module | Anomalous Essence | Dimensional Core |
| Refined Resonance Crystal | Refined Resonance Crystal | Anomalous Essence | Astral Projection Lens |

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Hypercomputation Core | 3 |
| Paranatural Composite | 3 |
| Radiant Cell | 1 |

## Supply Chain

The Synthesizer needs:
- **[[High-Tech Manufacturing#Particle Collider|Particle Collider]]** output (Hypercomputation Core, Paranatural Composite, Radiant Cell)
- **Anomalous Essence** from [[Creatures & Containment|creature capture]] → Essence Extractor
- A **continuously assigned creature** for the building to function

This means you need:
1. A working [[Nuclear Processing|nuclear chain]] for Radiant Cells
2. A Particle Collider producing Hypercomputation Cores and Paranatural Composite
3. A creature pipeline: Gathering Post → Containment Trap → Essence Extractor

> [!tip] Best Creature for Synthesizers
> An evolved **Void Fragment** (+30% to all stats) is the ideal assignment. A **Resonance Moth** (+70% evolved Efficiency) also works well — saving Anomalous Essence on some crafts.

## What the Outputs Are For
