# Nuclear Processing

The nuclear production chain is one of the most resource-intensive in the game. It produces **Radiant Cells**, a critical component for Clearance 7+ content.

## The Chain

```
Threshold Radiant Deposit → Extractor → Adv. Processor or Nuclear Distiller → Enriched Radiant
                                                                                      ↓
Structural Composite + Refined Resonance Crystal → Particle Collider → Paranatural Composite
                                                                                      ↓
                                   Enriched Radiant + Paranatural Composite → Radiant Cell
```

## Step by Step

### 1. Source Threshold Radiant

**Threshold Radiant** is the rarest base resource on the sphere. Scout the sphere for deposits — you may need to expand your [[Claiming Territory|territory]] to reach them.

### 2. Enrich It

Use either:
- **[[Advanced Production#Advanced Processor (Advanced Smelter)|Advanced Processor]]** (Clearance 4) — also processes other ores
- **[[High-Tech Manufacturing#Nuclear Distiller (Nuclear Refinery)|Nuclear Distiller]]** (Clearance 6) — dedicated uranium processing

### 3. Produce Paranatural Composite

Feed Structural Composite + Refined Resonance Crystal into a [[High-Tech Manufacturing#Particle Collider|Particle Collider]].

### 4. Produce Radiant Cells

Feed Enriched Radiant + Paranatural Composite into a Particle Collider.

## What Radiant Cells Are Used For

- [[Paranatural Synthesis|Paranatural Synthesizer]] construction (Clearance 7)
- Paranatural Synthesizer recipes (Dimensional Core)
- [[Research Case Files|Clearance 7 research]] (Paranatural Convergence case file)
- [[Board Contact Quest]] (50 required)

> [!tip] Start Nuclear Early
> Threshold Radiant deposits are rare and the chain is long. Begin scouting at Clearance 4–5 so you're ready when you reach Clearance 6.
