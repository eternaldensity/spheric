# High-Tech Manufacturing

**Clearance 6** unlocks two buildings that produce the most advanced materials in the game.

## Particle Collider

A dual-input building that creates ultra-advanced components through high-energy processes.

**Processing time:** 25 ticks

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Computation Matrix | Adv. Resonance Circuit | Hypercomputation Core |
| Structural Composite | Refined Resonance Crystal | Paranatural Composite |
| Enriched Radiant | Paranatural Composite | Radiant Cell |

**Cost:** 3 Computation Matrix, 5 Heavy Astral Frame, 5 Adv. Resonance Circuit, 1 Armored Drive Assembly

> [!note] The Hypercomputation Core is the most important late-game component — it's needed for nearly every Clearance 7–8 building and the [[Board Contact Quest]].

## Nuclear Refinery (Nuclear Distiller)

Processes uranium into enriched fuel. An alternative to the [[Advanced Production#Advanced Smelter (Advanced Processor)|Advanced Smelter]] for uranium enrichment.

**Processing time:** 20 ticks

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Threshold Radiant (Raw) | Enriched Radiant |

**Cost:** 5 Structural Composite, 2 Computation Matrix, 3 Heavy Astral Frame

## Production Dependencies

Building a Particle Collider requires outputs from:
- [[Advanced Production#Fabrication Plant|Fabrication Plant]] (Computation Matrix, Armored Drive Assembly)
- [[Advanced Production#Advanced Assembler (Advanced Fabricator)|Advanced Assembler]] (Heavy Astral Frame, Adv. Resonance Circuit)

This means you need a complete Clearance 5 production chain operational before you can construct Clearance 6 buildings.
