# The Board Interface

The **Board Interface** is the ultimate building in Spheric, unlocked at **Clearance 8**. It is the conduit through which Operators make contact with **The Board**.

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Paranatural Composite | 80 |
| Hypercomputation Core | 15 |
| Dimensional Core | 4 |
| Astral Projection Lens | 3 |

This is the **most expensive building in the game**. Constructing it requires a mature, multi-tier production network producing the highest-end components from:
- [[High-Tech Manufacturing|Particle Colliders]] (Hypercomputation Core, Paranatural Composite)
- [[Paranatural Synthesis|Paranatural Synthesizers]] (Dimensional Core, Astral Projection Lens)

## What It Does

The Board Interface enables the [[Board Contact Quest]] — the game's cooperative finale. Building one signals that your production capability has reached its peak.

## Getting to Clearance 8

Before you can build the Board Interface, you must complete all Clearance 8 [[Research Case Files|case files]]:

| Case File | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Dimensional Mastery | 3 Astral Projection Lens, 3 Dimensional Core |
| Board Resonance Protocol | 1 Board Resonator |

This requires the full [[Paranatural Synthesis|Paranatural Synthesis]] chain to be operational.
