# Advanced Logistics

Clearance 1 and 2 unlock several logistics buildings that let you build complex routing networks beyond simple [[The Conduit Network|Conduit]] chains.

## Conduit Tiers

Higher-tier conduits move items faster but cost more to build.

| Tier | Bureau Name | Clearance | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mk-I | Conduit | 0 | 1 Ferric Standard |
| Mk-II | Conduit Mk-II | Clearance 1 | 2 Ferric Standard, 1 Conductive Filament |
| Mk-III | Conduit Mk-III | Clearance 2 | 3 Structural Plate, 2 Conductive Filament |

See [[The Conduit Network]] for full details on conduit mechanics and Line Mode.

## Distributor (Splitter)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- **1 input → 3 outputs**
- Items are distributed round-robin to all connected output directions
- Use to fan out a production line to multiple consumers

**Cost:** 3 Ferric Standard, 2 Paraelectric Bar

---

## Converger (Merger)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- **2 inputs → 1 output**
- Accepts items from the left and right sides, pushes forward
- Use to combine two material streams into one conduit line

**Cost:** 3 Ferric Standard, 2 Paraelectric Bar

---

## Containment Vault (Storage Container)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- Buffers up to **100 items** of a single type
- Accepts items from the rear, outputs from the front
- Once an item type is set, only accepts that type until emptied
- Useful as a buffer between production stages or for stockpiling

**Cost:** 5 Ferric Standard, 2 Structural Plate

---

## Load Equalizer (Balancer)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- **1 input → 2 outputs** (left and right)
- Routes items to the less-full downstream building
- Falls back to alternating if both sides are equally available
- Use to evenly split production across parallel lines

**Cost:** 5 Structural Plate, 1 Resonance Circuit

---

## Subsurface Link (Underground Conduit)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- Tunnels items under one tile to a paired exit
- Place two Subsurface Links and use the **Link** button in the tile info panel to pair them
- Items enter at one end and emerge at the other, bypassing surface buildings
- Use to route around obstacles or cross paths without a Transit Interchange

**Cost:** 8 Structural Plate, 5 Conductive Filament

---

## Transit Interchange (Crossover)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- Two perpendicular conduit streams pass through without merging
- Horizontal items (W/E) use one slot, vertical items (N/S) use the other
- Each item passes straight through to the opposite side
- Use where two conduit lines need to cross paths

**Cost:** 4 Structural Plate, 1 Conductive Filament

---

## Transfer Station

*Unlocked at Clearance 4*

- Bridges items between [[Power & Energy#Substation|Substations]]
- Use to move items across longer distances without conduit chains

**Cost:** 10 Shielded Conductor, 6 Resonance Circuit, 2 Astral Frame
