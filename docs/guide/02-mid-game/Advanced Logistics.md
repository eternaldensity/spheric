# Advanced Logistics

Clearance 1 and 2 unlock several logistics buildings that let you build complex routing networks beyond simple [[The Conveyor Network|Conduit]] chains.

## Distributor (Splitter)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- **1 input → 3 outputs**
- Items are distributed round-robin to all connected output directions
- Use to fan out a production line to multiple consumers

**Cost:** 3 Ferric Standard, 2 Paraelectric Bar

## Converger (Merger)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- **Multiple inputs → 1 output**
- Accepts items from several directions, sends them all in one direction
- Use to consolidate multiple production lines into one stream

**Cost:** 3 Ferric Standard, 2 Paraelectric Bar

## Load Equalizer (Balancer)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- **1 input → 4 outputs**
- Distributes items evenly across all four directions in round-robin
- Ideal for feeding four parallel production lines

**Cost:** 5 Ferric Standard, 1 Resonance Circuit

## Subsurface Link (Underground Conduit)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- **Tunnels under 1 tile**
- Place entrance and exit — items skip the tile between them
- Useful for crossing other Conduit lines without conflict

**Cost:** 8 Ferric Standard, 5 Paraelectric Bar

## Transit Interchange (Crossover)

*Unlocked at Clearance 2*

- Allows **two Conduit paths to cross** without merging
- Items continue straight through in their original direction
- Essential for complex factory layouts

**Cost:** 4 Ferric Standard, 2 Conductive Filament

## Conduit Mk-II & Mk-III

Faster versions of the standard Conduit:

| Tier | Bureau Name | Unlocked At | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mk-II | Conduit Mk-II | Clearance 1 | 2 Ferric Standard, 1 Paraelectric Bar |
| Mk-III | Conduit Mk-III | Clearance 2 | 3 Ferric Standard, 2 Conductive Filament |

## Containment Vault (Storage Container)

*Unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]*

- Stores a buffer of items (**one item type** per container)
- Useful for buffering overproduction or staging items for construction sites
- Items flow in from Conduits and can be pulled out by downstream Conduits

**Cost:** 5 Ferric Standard, 2 Structural Plate

## Transfer Station

*Unlocked at Clearance 4*

- Bridges distant [[Power & Energy#Substation|Substations]]
- Allows power networks to reach across gaps
- Advanced logistics hub for large-scale factories

**Cost:** 10 Shielded Conduit, 2 Astral Frame, 3 Resonance Circuit
