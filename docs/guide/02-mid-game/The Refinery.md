# The Refinery

The **Refinery** (Bureau name: Distiller) processes liquid and volatile resources. It works like a [[Mining & Smelting|Smelter]] but handles different materials.

**Processing time:** 12 ticks per item

Unlocked at **Clearance 2**.

## Recipes

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Black Rock Ichor (Crude) — oil | Stabilized Polymer |
| Threshold Dust (Raw) — sulfur | Threshold Compound |
| Entity Biofuel | Refined Entity Fuel |

See [[Recipe Reference]] for the complete recipe list.

## Key Outputs

### Stabilized Polymer
Used in [[The Assembler|Assembler]] recipes for:
- **Shielded Conduit** (cable) — wire + polymer
- And later in [[Advanced Production|Advanced Assembler]] recipes

### Threshold Compound
Used in Assembler recipes for:
- **Thermal Regulator** (heat sink) — copper ingot + compound

### Refined Entity Fuel
A more efficient fuel source for [[Power & Energy|Bio Generators]]. Made from [[Creatures & Containment|creature]] biofuel.

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Ferric Standard | 10 |
| Structural Plate | 3 |
| Conductive Filament | 3 |
