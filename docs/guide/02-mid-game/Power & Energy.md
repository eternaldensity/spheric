# Power & Energy

At **Clearance 4**, you unlock the power system. Many advanced buildings require power to operate.

## Why Power Matters

> [!important] Unpowered buildings stall.
> Buildings without power stop producing entirely. Once you start building Clearance 4+ structures, power infrastructure is mandatory.

> [!note] Power switch vs. power network
> Every machine also has a manual **ON/OFF power switch** you can toggle from the tile info panel. This is separate from the power network — even a fully powered machine can be switched off by its operator. See [[Placing Your First Buildings#Power switch]].
