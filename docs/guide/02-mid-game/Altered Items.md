# Altered Items

Approximately **0.1% of tiles** contain an **Altered Item** — a permanent paranatural anomaly embedded in the terrain. When you build on an Altered Item tile, that building gains a special bonus.

## Altered Item Types

| Altered Item | Effect | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Resonance Accelerator | 2x production speed | Building tick rate halved |
| Probability Fracture | Output duplication | 5% chance per output to produce 2 items |
| Thermal Anomaly | 2x processing yield | [[Mining & Smelting|Smelters]] and [[The Refinery|Refineries]] output 2 per 1 input |
| Spatial Distortion | Triple capture radius | [[Creatures & Containment|Containment Trap]] radius: 3 → 9 tiles |
| Shifting Anchor | Skip downstream | Output items bypass the next building in the [[The Conveyor Network|chain]] |

## Finding Altered Items

- Click on any tile — the info panel shows **"Altered Item"** if one is present
- They have a distinctive visual indicator on the sphere
- At ~0.1% density, they are rare but extremely valuable

> [!tip] Scout First, Build Later
> Before placing high-value production buildings (Smelters, Assemblers, Fabrication Plants), scout the area for Altered Items. A Resonance Accelerator on your bottleneck building can double your throughput.

## Best Uses

| Altered Item | Ideal Building |
|---|---|
| Resonance Accelerator | Your slowest/bottleneck production building |
| Probability Fracture | High-value output buildings (late-game crafters) |
| Thermal Anomaly | Smelter or Refinery on your highest-demand material |
| Spatial Distortion | Containment Trap — captures creatures in a massive area |
| Shifting Anchor | Specific [[The Conveyor Network|conveyor]] routing optimizations |

## Altered Resonance (Late Game)

At Clearance 6, the **[[Objects of Power|Altered Resonance]]** Object of Power **doubles** all Altered Item effects. See [[Altered Items Reference]] for the doubled values.
