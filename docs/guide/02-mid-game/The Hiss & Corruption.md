# The Hiss & Corruption

**The Hiss** is a parasitic corruption that spreads across the sphere over time. It is the primary threat to your infrastructure.

## How Corruption Works

- Corruption appears on distant, unoccupied tiles
- It has an **intensity** from 1 to 10
- Spreads to adjacent tiles every **50 ticks**
- Higher intensity spreads faster and further

## Damage

- At **intensity 5+**, the Hiss damages buildings on that tile
- Buildings exposed to high-intensity Hiss for **25 ticks** are **destroyed**
- Destroyed buildings are lost — you'll need to rebuild them

> [!warning] Don't Ignore the Hiss
> Corruption grows slowly but relentlessly. A distant patch of Hiss can creep into your factory if left unchecked.

## Hiss Entities

Hiss Entities are hostile creatures that spawn from high-intensity corruption zones:

- Move toward nearby buildings and players
- Attack within **radius 3**
- Damage buildings they reach
- Must be killed by **Defense Arrays**
- Drop **Hiss Residue** when killed

Hiss Residue is needed for the [[Board Contact Quest|endgame quest]] — so fighting the Hiss is eventually necessary, not just defensive.

## Defense Buildings

Both unlocked at **Clearance 3**:

### Defense Array (Defense Turret)

- Auto-attacks Hiss entities within **radius 3**
- Kills entities and produces **Hiss Residue**
- Place at the perimeter of your factory facing corruption zones

**Cost:** 3 Astral Frame, 5 Structural Plate, 2 Resonance Circuit

### Purification Beacon

- Creates a **radius 5 immunity zone** where corruption cannot exist
- Actively pushes back corruption intensity in surrounding tiles
- Your primary long-term defense

**Cost:** 3 Astral Frame, 3 Resonance Circuit, 5 Refined Resonance Crystal

## Defense Strategy

1. **Purification Beacons first** — establish immunity zones around your core infrastructure
2. **Defense Arrays at borders** — place turrets where corruption is likely to approach
3. **Layer your defenses** — overlapping Purification Beacon radii create large safe zones
4. Assign [[Creatures & Containment|creatures]] with **Defense** boosts to your turrets for extra protection
5. Later, [[Endgame Buildings|Dimensional Stabilizers]] (Clearance 7) provide even wider protection
