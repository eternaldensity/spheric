# The Assembler

The **Assembler** (Bureau name: Fabricator) is unlocked at Clearance 2. It's the first building that accepts **two different inputs** and combines them into a component.

**Processing time:** 15 ticks per item

## Recipes

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Paraelectric Bar | Paraelectric Bar | Conductive Filament (wire) |
| Ferric Standard | Ferric Standard | Structural Plate |
| Conductive Filament | Refined Resonance Crystal | Resonance Circuit |
| Structural Plate | Astral Ingot | Astral Frame |
| Ferric Standard | Conductive Filament | Kinetic Driver (motor) |
| Conductive Filament | Stabilized Polymer | Shielded Conduit (cable) |
| Structural Plate | Ferric Standard | Reinforced Plate |
| Paraelectric Bar | Threshold Compound | Thermal Regulator (heat sink) |

See [[Recipe Reference]] for the complete list across all buildings.

## Dual-Input Logistics

> [!note] Layout Challenge
> The Assembler needs **two separate [[The Conveyor Network|conveyor]] lines** feeding it — one for each input. Plan your layouts carefully. You'll need to route two different material streams without crossing.

Use [[Advanced Logistics#Crossover (Transit Interchange)|Crossovers]] or [[Advanced Logistics#Underground Conduit (Subsurface Link)|Underground Conduits]] to handle path crossings.

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Ferric Standard | 8 |
| Paraelectric Bar | 5 |
| Conductive Filament | 3 |

## Tips

- Wire and Plate are the most frequently needed components — build dedicated production cells for them
- A single Assembler can only process one recipe at a time; build multiple Assemblers for different products
- Pair Assemblers with [[Advanced Logistics#Splitter (Distributor)|Splitters]] to distribute output to multiple destinations
