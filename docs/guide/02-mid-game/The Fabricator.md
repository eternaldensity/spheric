# The Fabricator

The **Fabricator** (commonly: Assembler) is unlocked at [[Reaching Clearance 1|Clearance 1]]. It's the first building that accepts **two different inputs** and combines them into a component.

**Processing time:** 15 ticks per item

## Recipes

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Paraelectric Bar | Paraelectric Bar | Conductive Filament |
| Ferric Standard | Ferric Standard | Structural Plate |
| Conductive Filament | Refined Resonance Crystal | Resonance Circuit |
| Structural Plate | Astral Ingot | Astral Frame |
| Ferric Standard | Conductive Filament | Kinetic Driver |
| Conductive Filament | Stabilized Polymer | Shielded Conductor |
| Structural Plate | Ferric Standard | Reinforced Plate |
| Paraelectric Bar | Threshold Compound | Thermal Regulator |

See [[Recipe Reference]] for the complete list across all buildings.

## Dual-Input Logistics

> [!note] Layout Challenge
> The Fabricator needs **two separate [[The Conduit Network|Conduit]] lines** feeding it — one for each input. Plan your layouts carefully. You'll need to route two different material streams without crossing.

Use [[Advanced Logistics#Transit Interchange (Crossover)|Transit Interchanges]] or [[Advanced Logistics#Subsurface Link (Underground Conduit)|Subsurface Links]] to handle path crossings.

## Construction Cost

| Material | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Ferric Standard | 8 |
| Paraelectric Bar | 5 |
| Astral Ingot | 2 |

## Tips

- Conductive Filament and Structural Plate are the most frequently needed components — build dedicated production cells for them
- A single Fabricator can only process one recipe at a time; build multiple Fabricators for different products
- Pair Fabricators with [[Advanced Logistics#Distributor (Splitter)|Distributors]] to distribute output to multiple destinations
