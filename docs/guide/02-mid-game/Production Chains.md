# Production Chains

> [!warning] Mid Game Content
> This page covers Clearance 2+ mechanics. If you're still in the early game, return to [[Early Game Tips]].

At Clearance 2, the game transforms from simple ore-to-ingot lines into complex **multi-step production chains**. You now deal with:

- Multiple resource types
- Multi-input buildings (the [[The Assembler|Assembler]] takes 2 different items)
- Intermediate components that feed into higher-tier recipes

## New Resources

Four new resources become relevant at Clearance 2:

| Resource | Bureau Name | Processed By | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quartz | Resonance Crystal | [[Mining & Smelting|Smelter]] | Refined Resonance Crystal |
| Titanium | Astral Ore | Smelter | Astral Ingot |
| Oil | Black Rock Ichor | [[The Refinery|Refinery]] | Stabilized Polymer |
| Sulfur | Threshold Dust | Refinery | Threshold Compound |

See [[Biomes & Resources]] for where to find these deposits.

## The Production Tree

At a high level, production flows through tiers:

```
Tier 0: Raw Ore
  ↓
Tier 1: Ingots (Smelter/Refinery)
  ↓
Tier 2: Basic Components (Assembler) — wire, plate, circuit, frame
  ↓
Tier 3: Advanced Components (Adv. Assembler) — heavy frame, adv. circuit
  ↓
Tier 4: Complex Items (Fabrication Plant) — computer, motor housing
  ↓
Tier 5+: Endgame Materials (Particle Collider, Synthesizer)
```

Each tier requires the outputs of the tier below it. Planning your layout to accommodate these chains is the core challenge of the mid game.

## Key Production Paths

### Wire & Plate (Foundation of everything)
```
Copper Ingot + Copper Ingot → Conductive Filament (wire)
Iron Ingot + Iron Ingot → Structural Plate
```

### Electronics
```
Wire + Quartz Crystal → Resonance Circuit
Plate + Titanium Ingot → Astral Frame
```

### Mechanical
```
Iron Ingot + Wire → Kinetic Driver (motor)
Wire + Polymer → Shielded Conduit (cable)
```

See [[Recipe Reference]] for complete recipe tables.
