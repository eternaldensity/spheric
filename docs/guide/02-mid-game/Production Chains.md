# Production Chains

> [!warning] Mid Game Content
> This page covers Clearance 2+ mechanics. If you're still in the early game, return to [[Early Game Tips]].

At Clearance 2, the game transforms from simple ore-to-ingot lines into complex **multi-step production chains**. You now deal with:

- Multiple resource types
- Multi-input buildings (the [[The Fabricator|Fabricator]] takes 2 different items)
- Intermediate components that feed into higher-tier recipes

## New Resources

Four new resources become relevant at Clearance 2:

| Bureau Name | Common Name | Processed By | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance Crystal | Quartz | [[Extraction & Processing|Processor]] | Refined Resonance Crystal |
| Astral Ore | Titanium | Processor | Astral Ingot |
| Black Rock Ichor | Oil | [[The Distiller|Distiller]] | Stabilized Polymer |
| Threshold Dust | Sulfur | Distiller | Threshold Compound |

See [[Biomes & Resources]] for where to find these deposits.

## The Production Tree

At a high level, production flows through tiers:

```
Tier 0: Raw Ore
  ↓
Tier 1: Ingots (Processor/Distiller)
  ↓
Tier 2: Basic Components (Fabricator) — Conductive Filament, Structural Plate, Resonance Circuit, Astral Frame
  ↓
Tier 3: Advanced Components (Adv. Fabricator) — Heavy Astral Frame, Adv. Resonance Circuit
  ↓
Tier 4: Complex Items (Fabrication Plant) — Computation Matrix, Armored Drive Assembly
  ↓
Tier 5+: Endgame Materials (Particle Collider, Synthesizer)
```

Each tier requires the outputs of the tier below it. Planning your layout to accommodate these chains is the core challenge of the mid game.

## Key Production Paths

### Conductive Filament & Structural Plate (Foundation of everything)
```
Paraelectric Bar + Paraelectric Bar → Conductive Filament
Ferric Standard + Ferric Standard → Structural Plate
```

### Electronics
```
Conductive Filament + Refined Resonance Crystal → Resonance Circuit
Structural Plate + Astral Ingot → Astral Frame
```

### Mechanical
```
Ferric Standard + Conductive Filament → Kinetic Driver
Conductive Filament + Stabilized Polymer → Shielded Conductor
```
