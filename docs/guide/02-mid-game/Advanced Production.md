# Advanced Production

At Clearance 4–5, you unlock higher-tier production buildings that process more complex materials.

## Advanced Processor (Advanced Smelter)

*Unlocked at Clearance 4*

- **Faster** processing: 8 ticks vs [[Extraction & Processing|standard Processor's]] 10
- Handles all standard Processor recipes **plus** uranium:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Threshold Radiant (Raw) | Enriched Radiant |

This is the first building that processes **Threshold Radiant** (uranium), a critical resource for [[High-Tech Manufacturing|late-game]] production.

**Cost:** 12 Heavy Astral Frame, 8 Thermal Regulator, 5 Resonance Circuit
