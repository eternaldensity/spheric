# Advanced Production

At Clearance 4–5, you unlock higher-tier production buildings that process more complex materials.

## Advanced Processor (Advanced Smelter)

*Unlocked at Clearance 4*

- **Faster** processing: 8 ticks vs [[Extraction & Processing|standard Processor's]] 10
- Handles all standard Processor recipes **plus** uranium:

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| Threshold Radiant (Raw) | Enriched Radiant |

This is the first building that processes **Threshold Radiant** (uranium), a critical resource for [[High-Tech Manufacturing|late-game]] production.

**Cost:** 1 Heavy Astral Frame, 5 Resonance Circuit, 3 Thermal Regulator

## Advanced Fabricator (Advanced Assembler)

*Unlocked at Clearance 5*

- **Faster** processing: 12 ticks vs [[The Fabricator|standard Fabricator's]] 15
- New recipes using mid-tier components:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Astral Frame | Reinforced Plate | Heavy Astral Frame |
| Resonance Circuit | Shielded Conduit | Advanced Resonance Circuit |
| Stabilized Polymer | Threshold Compound | Polymer Membrane |

These outputs are required for Fabrication Plant recipes and higher.

**Cost:** 2 Heavy Astral Frame, 3 Adv. Resonance Circuit, 2 Kinetic Driver

## Fabrication Plant

*Unlocked at Clearance 5*

The first **triple-input** building — requires three different materials.

**Processing time:** 20 ticks

| Input A | Input B | Input C | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adv. Resonance Circuit | Adv. Resonance Circuit | Polymer Membrane | Computation Matrix |
| Heavy Astral Frame | Kinetic Driver | Thermal Regulator | Armored Drive Assembly |
| Reinforced Plate | Polymer Membrane | Astral Ingot | Structural Composite |

> [!note] Three Input Lines
> Like the Fabricator but more complex — you need to route **three** separate [[The Conveyor Network|Conduit]] streams. Use [[Advanced Logistics|Transit Interchanges and Subsurface Links]] liberally.

**Cost:** 3 Heavy Astral Frame, 5 Adv. Resonance Circuit, 3 Kinetic Driver, 5 Shielded Conduit

## Essence Extractor

*Unlocked at Clearance 5*

Extracts **Anomalous Essence** from [[Creatures & Containment|assigned creatures]], producing the biofuel that powers your [[Power & Energy|Bio Generators]].

**Cost:** 3 Astral Frame, 5 Resonance Circuit, 10 Refined Resonance Crystal
