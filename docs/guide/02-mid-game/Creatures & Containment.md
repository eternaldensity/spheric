# Creatures & Containment

At **Clearance 3**, you unlock the **Trap**, which lets you capture the wild creatures roaming the sphere.

## Wild Creatures

Twelve types of **Altered Entities** spawn naturally across the sphere. Each creature:

- Spawns in [[Biomes & Resources|biome]]-appropriate locations
- Wanders randomly every 5 ticks
- Is attracted to **Gathering Posts** (within radius 7)
- Provides a specific **boost type** when assigned to a building

Up to **200 wild creatures** exist on the sphere at once. New creatures spawn every 25 ticks (1–3 at a time).

## Capturing Creatures

1. Place a **Gathering Post** (free, from your [[Your Starter Kit|Starter Kit]]) to attract creatures to your area
2. Place a **Trap** nearby — captures creatures within **radius 3**
3. Wait — capture takes **15 ticks** once a creature enters range
4. Captured creatures appear in your **Containment Records** panel (**C** key)

> [!tip] Attraction
> Creatures within radius 7 of a Gathering Post have a 30% chance each movement tick to move toward it. Place your Post and Trap near each other for best results.

## Assigning Creatures to Buildings

Once captured, assign a creature to any building you own:

1. Open Containment Records (**C**)
2. Select a creature
3. Select the target building on the sphere
4. Click **"Deploy to selected structure"**

The creature provides a passive boost based on its type:

| Boost Type | Effect |
|---|---|
| Speed | Reduces tick rate (faster production) |
| Efficiency | Chance to not consume input materials |
| Output | Chance to produce double output |
| Defense | Resistance to [[The Hiss & Corruption|Hiss]] damage |
| Area | Increases building's range/area effects |
| All | Small bonus to everything |

## Creature Evolution

Creatures assigned to a building for **600 continuous seconds** undergo **evolution**, which **doubles their boost**.

> [!important] Keep Them Assigned
> The evolution timer resets if you recall a creature. For maximum benefit, assign creatures and leave them.

## Best Creatures

| Creature | Boost | Amount | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Void Fragment | All | +15% (→ +30% evolved) | Boosts everything; rarest |
| Flux Serpent | Speed | +50% (→ +100% evolved) | Highest speed boost |
| Resonance Moth | Efficiency | +35% (→ +70% evolved) | Best material savings |
| Phase Wisp | Area | +60% (→ +120% evolved) | Huge range increase |

See [[Creature Reference]] for the complete list with biomes and stats.
