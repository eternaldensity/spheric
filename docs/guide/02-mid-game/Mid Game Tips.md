# Mid Game Tips

> [!tip] Scaling Up
> The mid game is where factory planning becomes critical. These tips will help you manage complexity.

## Production

- **Plan before you build.** Sketch your [[Production Chains|production chains]] on paper if needed. Multi-input buildings require careful routing.
- **Use Blueprints.** Capture a working building pattern and stamp it elsewhere. Great for repeating production cells.
- **Build dedicated cells.** One production cell per output type (e.g., a "wire cell" with miners → smelters → assembler) keeps things organized.

## Creatures

- **Capture early.** Place Gathering Posts and [[Creatures & Containment|Traps]] as soon as you unlock them at Clearance 3. Even if you can't use all boosts yet, captured creatures start their 600-second evolution timer.
- **Evolve your best creatures.** A Void Fragment assigned for 600+ seconds becomes incredibly powerful.
- **Speed on bottlenecks.** Assign Speed creatures to your slowest production buildings.

## Resources

- **Diversify.** You need all 6 base resources (iron, copper, quartz, titanium, oil, sulfur) by Clearance 3. Start scouting for deposits early.
- **Watch for depletion.** Deposits have 100–500 units. Plan for replacement miners as deposits run dry.

## Power

- **[[Power & Energy|Power]] is a bottleneck.** Biofuel supply limits your advanced production. Plan your energy infrastructure as carefully as your production lines.
- **Substation placement.** Build factory clusters that fit within a Substation's radius 10.

## Defense

- **Defend proactively.** [[The Hiss & Corruption|Purification Beacons]] are cheaper than rebuilding destroyed factories.
- **Layer defenses.** Don't rely on a single beacon — overlap coverage for safety.

## Collaboration

- **[[Trading with Other Operators|Trade]] your surplus.** Specialize in what your territory offers and trade for what it doesn't.
