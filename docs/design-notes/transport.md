# Design Notes: Rail Transport

## Current Logistics Hierarchy

| Scale | Solution | Throughput | Range |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Local (tile-to-tile) | Conveyors Mk1-3 | 1.67 - 5 items/sec | Adjacent tile |
| Short (2 tiles) | Loader/Unloader arms | 5-50 items/sec | Manhattan dist ≤2 |
| Mid-range | Underground conduits | Limited by feeder belt | Adjacent faces only |
| Construction supply | Delivery drones | 2 items/trip | ~1 cell (~16 tiles) |
| Vertical (up) | Mega drones + bulk vault | ~1.5-5 items/tick | Between scaffold levels |
| Long-range bulk | ??? | — | — |

## Do We Need Mass Transit (Trains/Rails)?

**Conclusion: No — the economy doesn't generate enough long-distance bulk demand.**

The resource distribution is designed so that:

- **Tier 0-5**: Any face is self-sufficient. All 6 common resources (iron, copper, quartz, titanium, oil, sulfur) spawn in every biome.
- **Ice** (tundra-only): One-time bootstrap need of ~50-100 units. Once a Freezer has 1 coolant_cube, the recipe `20 water + 2 coolant_cube → 20 ice + 2 coolant_cube` is self-sustaining.
- **Uranium** (volcanic-only): The only true ongoing cross-face dependency, but throughput needs are modest — a nuclear production chain consumes items slowly (particle collider: 25 enriched per cell, 25-tick cycle). A single conduit pair handles this.

The scarcity is in **production rate**, not **distribution capacity**. A handful of underground conduit pairs chained across adjacent faces handles all cross-face needs. The real logistics challenge is local — getting ore from mines through smelters and assemblers across a single face.

## Where Trains Could Add Value (If Revisited)

Not as a logistics necessity, but as:

- **Multiplayer trade automation** — replacing manual trade terminal exchanges with automated routes between player bases
- **Spectacle and world-feel** — trains moving across the sphere surface make the world feel alive
- **Endgame infrastructure hobby** — a macro-scale project for players with running factories
- **Note**: Vertical transport (between scaffold levels) is handled by mega drones, not rail. See [vertical-building.md](vertical-building.md).

## Unique Sphere Geometry Opportunities

If trains are ever added, the rhombic triacontahedron creates interesting design space:

- **Great circle routes**: Rails following geodesic paths across curved face surfaces
- **Face-edge junctions**: The 60 edges become natural interchange points
- **Vertex hubs**: 32 vertices (where 3 or 5 faces meet) are natural "Grand Central" locations
- **Orbital loops**: Equatorial/latitudinal trade rings connecting biome types

## FBC Lore Fit

Rail cars could be Altered Items — impossible vehicles traversing "thresholds" (face boundaries). The rail network as the "Astral Rail" or "Transit Conduit".
